# BusinessTreeSelect

Provides the same functionality as BusinessSelect, but works with **tree** data instead of flat lists.

Define once, use conveniently across your entire application.

Here's the component initialization example:

```js
import { BusinessTreeSelectBuilder } from 'react-admin-kit';

// Define type for code hinting
type TreeSelectType = 'org';

const BusinessTreeSelect = BusinessTreeSelectBuilder<TreeSelectType>(
  {
    apis: [
      {
        type: 'org',
        api: queryOrgFunction,
      },
    ],
  })

// Usage in pages
<BusinessTreeSelect type="org" />;
```

> Since it processes tree data, pagination is not needed. The API should return an array of objects directly, with `name` as display text and `id` as value by default.

## Basic Usage

`BusinessTreeSelect` is a wrapper around <Link src='https://ant.design/components/tree-select#api'>Antd TreeSelect</Link>, so it accepts all Antd TreeSelect properties.

## Cascading

- This example shows department options cascading based on company selection.

- Use `queryParams` to pass parameters to the API.

## Clear Cache

Use `clearTreeSelectCache(type: string)` to clear cache. Omitting `type` clears all type caches.

## onLoad Event

Triggered when dropdown data finishes loading. This event is useful for certain scenarios, such as auto-selecting the first item.
