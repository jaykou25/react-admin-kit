# Product Overview

React Admin Kit (RAK) is a React component library built on top of Ant Design, specifically designed for rapidly building forms and tables in admin/dashboard systems.

## Core Purpose
- Accelerate development of admin system forms and tables
- Reduce maintenance costs through consistent, configuration-driven APIs
- Enable easy reuse of forms and tables across different pages through schema-based configuration

## Key Features
- **Schema-driven**: Forms and tables are generated from configuration arrays
- **Built on proven foundations**: Uses Ant Design and ProComponents as base
- **Three core components**: SchemaForm, ModalForm, and ProTable that compose together
- **Transparent API**: Properties can be passed through between composed components

## Target Users
- Frontend developers building admin/dashboard systems
- Teams looking to standardize form and table implementations
- Projects requiring rapid prototyping of CRUD interfaces

## Differentiators from ProComponents
- Focused specifically on forms and tables (not a full suite)
- Schema-centric approach for better reusability
- Simplified documentation and component selection
- Gradual learning curve with transparent API design
